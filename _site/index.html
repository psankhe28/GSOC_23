        <p>Hey, my name is Pratiksha Sankhe and I study at VJTI in Mumbai. This is the first time applying for GSoC. After researching a wide range of organisations and learning about their initiatives, I discovered the ‚Äú<em>Collection and Study Management</em>‚Äù project of <strong>caMicroscope</strong> to be pretty fascinating.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>I joined Slack and began delving more into the projects. I finished the setup locally and started working on the coding challenge task listed under my project. This blog will summarise my approach to finishing the code challenge assignment.</p>

<h2 id="getting-warmed-up">Getting Warmed up</h2>
<p>Each project included a code challenge assignment for new contributors to demonstrate their inventiveness, comprehension of the topic, and ability to execute on a project proposal. I, too, began to comprehend and apply it.</p>

<h3 id="1-building-camicroscope-and-running-it-locally">1. Building caMicroscope and running it locally</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First I followed the <a href="https://github.com/camicroscope/caMicroscope#hosted-setup">Getting Started</a> section on caMicroscope's repository, which involved installing it using docker. I was able to successfully build and test its working on my PC.
  <li>Then, I started exploring the different pages and finding bugs in the pages of <a href="https://github.com/camicroscope/caMicroscope">caMicroscope</a> repository and <a href="https://github.com/camicroscope/camicroscope.github.io">camicroscope.github.io</a> repository.
  <li>Following are the PRs that I have raised till date:
      In <a href="https://github.com/camicroscope/camicroscope.github.io">camicroscope.github.io</a>:<br/>
      ‚óè <a href="https://github.com/camicroscope/camicroscope.github.io/pull/23">Scroll to top feature added</a><br/>

<h3 id="2-a-simple-webapp-demonstrating-crud-operations">2. A simple webapp demonstrating CRUD operations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>As I already made similar application using MERN Stack which performed CRUD operations, this was a fairly easy task for me.I created a react-app and then installed the dependencies required for creating stories.</li>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npx create-react-app notebook
  </code></pre></div></div>
  <li>I decided to create a 'backend' folder and initialize the application.
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm init -y
    </code></pre></div></div>
  </li>
  <li>My next target was to build models for User and Notes.</li>
  <li>For authentication, I made use of jsonwebtoken and bcrypt.js for hashing passwords.</li>
  <li>The next step which I performed was created the routes for authentication as well as notes which included POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests.
  <li>Finally I created routes and tested it. Tadaa! Everything was working fine.</li>
  <li>The backend was running smoothly and now the only part remaining was frontend.</li>
  <li>For keeping things simple, I used Bootstrap and use the already built forms for signup, login and adding and updating notes.</li>
  <li>I used the navbar which was already available in Bootstrap.
  <li>To connect the backend with frontend, I made use of Context and using it, I successfully completed the task.</li>
  <li>A cloud-based note application was created successfully.</li>

<h3 id="3-creating-url-storing-website">3. Creating URL Storing Website - UrlSafe</h3>
<ul>
  <li>After reading about project description and creating a simple CRUD operation website, I thought of creating a website which somewhat is a mini version of our project.</li>
  <li>So, I decided to make a website which utilizes the concept of collection and tags and I came up with the idea of UrlSafe.</li>
  <li>UrlSafe is a bookmark + archive manager to collect, and save websites for offline use.</li>
  <li>Some of the key features are as folows:<br/>
    - Sleek, minimalist design.<br/>
    - üå§ Dark/Light mode support.<br/>
    - ‚ÜîÔ∏è Responsive design.<br/>
    - üîé Search, filter and sorting functionality.<br/>
    - üè∑ Set multiple tags to each link.<br/>
    - üóÇ Assign each link to a collection where we can further group links.<br/>
  </li>
  <li>  In "Collection and Study Management" project too, we have to implement collection and tag feature which would be similar to this. </li>
  <li> This website is built using MERN Stack</li>
